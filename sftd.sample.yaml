# Sample configuration file for sftd, the Okta Privileged Access Server Agent
# Copy this file to sftd.yaml and uncomment any customizations
# you need to make.

# ----------------------------------------
# Enrollment Options
# These options control how you add an enrollment token to your server.
# ----------------------------------------
# Forces the server agent to attempt to automatically enroll during the initial startup.
#AutoEnroll: True 

# Specifies the path to a separate file containing an enrollment token. The default value
# depends on the operating system running the server agent. After the server is enrolled, 
# the server agent deletes this token file.If using this option, you must manually create 
# the token file and add an enrollment token created on the Okta Privileged Access platform. 
#EnrollmentTokenFile: /var/lib/sftd/enrollment.token  

# When AutoEnroll is set to True, this option specifies a URL used to automatically enroll 
# the server. If the EnrollmentTokenFile option is also configured, this option is ignored.
# Note: This option is only used by legacy installations not hosted by Okta Privileged 
# Access instances. (default is unset)
#InitialURL: 

# ----------------------------------------
# Log Options
# This option controls how the gateway logs events.
# ----------------------------------------
# Controls the verbosity of the logs.Valid values include: warn, info, debug
#LogLevel: INFO  

# ----------------------------------------
# Connection Options
# These options control how the agent manages connections
# ----------------------------------------
# Specifies the network address (IPv4 or IPv6) used by clients to access servers with multiple
# interfaces or behind DNATs. (default is unset)
#AccessAddress: 

# Specifies the interface used by clients to negotiate connections to the host. 
# Example: AccessInterface: eth0
#AccessInterface:  

# Specifies a list of alternative server hostnames. These names can be used as targets for sft ssh.
# Example: AltNames: ["web01", "web01.example.com"] 
#AltNames: 

# Specifies a bastion host used automatically by clients when connecting to this server. 
# (default is unset)
#Bastion: 

# Specifies the path prefix to the files used for the server agent local buffer store. 
# Individual buffer file names consist of the path prefix, followed by a period and an incremental 
# number (for example, buffer.db.1). Buffer files are automatically removed after being synchronized.
#BufferFile: /var/lib/sftd/buffer.db  

# Specifies the name that clients should use when connecting to this host. This option overrides 
# the name returned by the hostname command. Example: CanonicalName: "opa_linux_1"
# (default is unset). 
#CanonicalName: 

# Specifies the URL of an HTTP CONNECT proxy that the server agent uses for outbound network 
# connectivity to the Okta Privileged Access platform. Alternatively, the HTTPS_PROXY environment
# variable can be used to configure this proxy. ForwardProxy: https://myproxydomain.com:8080 (default is unset)
#ForwardProxy: 

# Specifies the path to a file used to store the server URL of the server that it connects to.
#ServerFile: /var/lib/sftd/device.server  

# Specifies the path to the sshd configuration file.Note: The server agent modifies this file.
#SSHDConfigFile: /etc/ssh/sshd_config 

# Specifies a port to use when negotiating SSH connections. This option is only needed if the default 
# port (22) isn't being used. This option tells the sft client (ScaleFT Client-Tools) how to connect 
# to the sftd Agent (ScaleFT Server-Tools). You must also modify the sshd_config file on the server 
# agent server to listen on the specified port. (default is unset)
#SSHDPort: 

# Specifies the path to a file used to store the secret authentication token for Okta Privileged Access.
#TokenFile: /var/lib/sftd/device.token  

# Specifies the path to a file used by the server agent to store a list of trusted SSH Certificate Authorities.
#TrustedUserCAKeysFile: /var/lib/sftd/ssh_ca.pub  

# ----------------------------------------
# Access Broker Options
# ----------------------------------------
# Specifies a port used by clients to reach the access broker.
#BrokerAccessPort: 4421  

# Specifies the network address (IPv4 or IPv6) used by the access broker to listen for connections. 
# By default, the access broker listens for connections on every available interface. (default is unset)
#BrokerListenHost: 

# Specifies a port used by the access broker to listen for connections.
#BrokerListenPort: 4421  

# Controls the operation status of the access broker. Set to True to restrict the access broker from running
# on the server.Note: Disabling the access broker process isn't recommended on Windows. See Windows Internals. (default is unset)
#DisableBroker:
